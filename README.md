# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This application is a planner for an average employee who works a regular 9-to-5 job. They can use this application to plan events for their day with the added ease of knowing what the current date is and the planner being color coded for past, present, and future hours. This project was important to complete because time management is key to any employees success. Being able to plan events ahead of time will make everyone's lives a lot easier and is important for everyone to practice. I was motivated to complete this project because I myself have used planners to schedule my days in the future and understand how useful planners can be.
